        <h3>Pokedex</h3>
        <p>You will learn more about Pokémons, obviously... and more about API integration with infinite loading,
          dynamic rendering and RWD, interactive search panel, sorting, filtering and a detailed view with data handling!
        Every Pokémon creature has an array of stats. HP (Hit Points) is a Pokémon's life force. If your Pokémon's HP hits zero, it faints and is no longer usable in battle (it can still use Hidden Machines, though).
          The Speed stat decides which Pokémon will make the first move in battle. This stat can be critical in long battles.</p>

        <h3>Music Player</h3>
        <p>You will learn more about UI controls, data handling, event handling, audio playback, and a cool UX/UI Design.In this project, you'll code a basic MP3 player using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The project covers fundamental concepts such as handling audio playback, managing a playlist, 
          implementing play, pause, next, previous, and shuffle functionalities.</p>
